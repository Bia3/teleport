This guide will help you to:

- Install and configure Teleport.
- Set up access to Azure SQL Server using Azure Active Directory authentication.
- Connect to Azure SQL Server through Teleport.

## Prerequisites

- A SQL Server running on Azure.
- Teleport Database Service running on an Azure virtual instance.

(!docs/pages/includes/user-client-prereqs.mdx!)

## Step 1/7. Set up the Teleport Auth and Proxy

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/start-auth-proxy.mdx!)

## Step 2/7. Create a Teleport user

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/create-user.mdx!)

## Step 3/7. Enable SQL Server Azure Active Directory integration

If you have it enabled, you can go to the next step.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Database
   servers**, and select the database you wish to enable the Azure Active Directory
   integration.
2. Select **Azure Active Directory** in the left-hand column.
3. Select **Set Admin**, and choose an account that will be added as an admin
   login to SQL Server.

## Step 4/7. Configure Azure Managed Identities

The Teleport Database Service needs access tokens from Azure AD to authenticate with
SQL Server databases.

It uses the managed identities attached to its Virtual Machine to fetch the
authentication token.

To create a new user-assigned managed identity, go to the **Managed Identities**
page in your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity%2FuserAssignedIdentities)
and click on *Create*. Choose a name and resource group for it and create:

![Azure Create user managed identity page](../../../img/database-access/guides/sqlserver/azure-user-managed-identity.png)

Next, go to the **Teleport Database Service virtual machine instance**,
**Identity** section, select **User assigned**, and add the identity we just
created:

![Azure Virtual machine user managed identities page](../../../img/database-access/guides/sqlserver/azure-attach-managed-identity-vm.png)

## Step 5/7. Enable managed identities login on SQL Server

Connect to your SQL Server using a pre-existent authentication method or the
Activity Directory Admin set on
[Step 3](#step-37-enable-sql-server-active-directory-integration).

Create a [contained user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/contained-database-users-making-your-database-portable?view=sql-server-ver16)
for your identities:
```sql
CREATE USER [sqlserver-identity] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
```

The newly created user will be attached to the public role, which might not
have enough permissions to perform queries. Consider granting individual
permissions to the user or assigning it to an existing role. For example, add the user as a member of the
`db_datareader` role:
```sql
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [sqlserver-identity];
```

<Admonition type="note">
Since we’re creating contained users, this step needs to be done on each
database we want to be able to log in.
</Admonition>

## Step 6/7. Start Teleport Database Service

Generate a configuration file at `/etc/teleport.yaml` for the Database Service:

```code
$ teleport db configure create \
   -o file \
   --token=/tmp/token \
   --proxy=teleport.example.com:3080 \
   --name=sqlserver \
   --protocol=sqlserver \
   --uri=my-server.database.windows.net:1433 \
   --labels=env=dev
```

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  A single Teleport process can run multiple different services, for example
  multiple Database Service agents as well as the SSH Service or Application
  Service.
  
</Admonition>

Start the database service:

```code
$ teleport start --config=/etc/teleport.yaml
```

## Step 7/7. Connect

Login into your Teleport Cluster. Your database should appear in the list of
available databases:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=alice
$ tsh db ls
# Name      Description         Labels
# --------- ------------------- -------
# sqlserver                     env=dev
```

To retrieve credentials for a database and connect to it:

```code
$ tsh db connect --db-user=sqlserver-identity --db-name=master sqlserver
```

Where `--db-user` is the managed identity name.

<Admonition type="note">
  The `mssql-cli` command-line client should be available in `PATH` of the machine
  you're running `tsh db connect` from.
</Admonition>

## Troubleshooting

### Could not find identity

If you see the error `could not find identity "my-identity" attached to the
instance` when connecting to your database, then the identity you’re trying to
connect with is not attached to the Teleport Database Service Virtual Machine.
You can navigate to the [Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines),
open the **Teleport instance**, **Identity** section, and choose **User
assigned** to see all identities you can connect with. If you don’t see your
identity check [Step 4](#step-47-configure-azure-managed-identities) to see how
to add it.

### Login failed for the user

When connecting to your database, you see the error `mssql: login error: Login
failed for user '<token-identified principal>'`, it means your managed identity
login is not present on the SQL database. You’ll need to create their users as
described in [Step 5](#step-57-enable-managed-identities-login-on-sql-server).
Remember: you must create the users on all databases you want to connect.
