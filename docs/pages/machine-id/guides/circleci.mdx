## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A node that is a part of the Teleport cluster with
[Server Access](https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/introduction/) and a
user you want to grant access to. In this guide, we will use `my-node` and
`ci-user` respectively.
- A local workstation with `tsh` access to the cluster.
- A CircleCI project connected to a Git repository you can push to.

## Step 1/4. Configure CircleCI

In order to configure the rules for which CircleCI workflows will be allowed to
connect to your Teleport cluster, you must determine the ID of your CircleCI
organization and create a CircleCI context.

### Find your Organization ID

Open CircleCI and navigate to "Organization settings" from the navbar.
You should be presented with an interface titled "Overview" with a section
called "Organization ID". Note this value down and substitute `$ORGANIZATION_ID`
in configuration examples provided in this guide with that value.

### Create a Context

// TODO: Explain what a CircleCI context is and how to make one, named
`teleport-access`.

## Step 2/4. Create the join token for CircleCI

In order to allow your CircleCI workflow to authenticate with your Teleport
cluster, you'll first need to create a join token. These tokens set out criteria
by which the Auth Server decides whether or not to allow a bot or node to join.

To create a token, we can write the resource's YAML to a file on disk, and then
use `tctl` to apply it.

Create a file named `tokenconfig.yaml`, ensuring that you replace
`$ORGANIZATION_ID` and `$CONTEXT_ID` with the values from step 1.

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: circleci-demo
  expires: "2100-01-01T00:00:00Z"
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: circleci
  bot_name: circleci-demo
  circleci:
    organization_id: $ORGANIZATION_ID
    allow:
      - context: $CONTEXT_ID
```

Let's go over the token resource's fields in more detail:

- `metadata.name` defines the name of the token. Note that this value will need
to be used in other parts of the configuration later.
- `metadata.expires` defines the date that the join token will expire. This
example is set to the year `2100`.
- `spec.bot_name` is the name of the Machine ID bot that this token will grant
access to. Note that this value will need to be used in other parts of the
configuration later.
- `spec.roles` defines which roles that this token will grant access to. The
value of `[Bot]` states that this token grants access to a Machine ID bot.
- `spec.join_method` defines the join method the token is applicable for. Since
this guide only focuses on CircleCI, we will set this to to `circleci`.
- `spec.circleci.allow` is used to set rules for what CircleCI runs will be able
to authenticate by using the token.

Apply this to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f tokenconfig.yaml
```

## Step 3/4. Create a Machine ID bot

With the join token for the CircleCI project created, you now need to create a
Machine ID bot that the token will grant access to. A Machine ID bot is a
special type of Teleport user designed for access by machines, and can
authenticate using a join token rather than forms of authentication more
suitable to users (e.g such as SSO.)

For this guide, we are using the default `access` role and explicitly stating
that the bot should have access to the `ci-user` login on hosts. In production
environments, we recommend creating a custom role for your CI/CD workflow and
ensuring that this role has no more permissions than is needed for the workflow
to complete its tasks.

Use `tctl` to create the bot:

```code
$ tctl bots add circleci-demo --roles=access --logins=ci-user --token=circleci-token
```

## Step 4/4. Configure CircleCI workflow

With the token and bot now configured, you can now create a CircleCI workflow
that can connect to your Teleport cluster.

Our example workflow will connect to a SSH node named `my-node` and write a
line to a file that links back to the CI/CD run. This is a trivial example and
could be replaced with pushing new configuration or binaries over SSH.

Open your Git repository and create a directory called `.circleci`. Then open
a file called `config.yml` and insert the following configuration. Replace
`tele.example.com:443` with the public-facing address of your Teleport Proxy or
cloud tenant (e.g. `example.teleport.sh`). Replace `my-node` with the name of
the Teleport node that you wish to connect to and replace `ci-user` with the
login you configured in step 3.

```yaml
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
version: 2.1
jobs:
  write-run-log:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Install Teleport"
          command: |
            cd /tmp
            curl -O https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
            tar -xvf teleport-(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
            sudo ./teleport/install
      - run:
          name: "Use Machine ID to access Teleport Node"
          command: |
            tbot start \
              --auth-server=tele.example.com:443 \
              --join-method=circleci --token=circleci-demo \
              --oneshot \
              --destination-dir=./certs \
              --data-dir=/tmp/tbot-data
            tsh \
              -i ./certs/identity \
              --proxy tele.example.com:443 \
              ssh ci-user@my-node \
              "echo $CIRCLE_BUILD_URL >> ~/circle_run_log_demo"
workflows:
  write-run-log:
    jobs:
      - write-run-log:
          context:
            - teleport-access
```

Add, commit, and push this new configuration file to your repository.

Open CircleCI and check the status of the job, wait for it to complete and
ensure that no errors are emitted.

SSH into `my-node` and confirm that a file has been created in ci-user's home
directory named `circle_run_log` with a link to the build in CircleCI.
