description: Use Teleport's Terraform Provider to deploy Login Rules to your cluster

<Admonition type="warning" title="Preview">
  Login Rules are currently in Preview mode.
</Admonition>

This guide will explain how to:

- Use Teleport's Terraform Provider to deploy Login Rules to your Teleport cluster
- Edit deployed Login Rules via Terraform

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)


- [Terraform >= (=terraform.version=)+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```code
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v(=terraform.version=)
  ```

## Step 1/4. Set up Teleport credentials for Terraform

For simplicity, this guide will configure the Terraform provider to use your
current logged-in user's Teleport credentials obtained from `tsh login`.

<Admonition type="note">
The [Terraform provider guide](../../management/guides/terraform-provider.mdx)
includes instructions for configuring a dedicated `terraform` user and role,
which is a better option when running Terraform in a non-interactive
environment.

If you are already using Terraform to manage other resources in your Teleport
cluster then you have probably already set up a `terraform` user and role and
configured the associated credentials.
Make sure to use the `terraform` role from the latest version of the guide,
which has `list`, `read`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` verbs for
`login_rule` resources.
</Admonition>

First, ensure you are logged into Teleport as a user that has permissions to
read and modify `login_rule` resources.
The preset `editor` role has access to this already, but in case you are using a
more customized configuration, create a role called `loginrule-manager.yaml`
with the following contents:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: loginrule-manager
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: [login_rule]
        verbs: [list, read, create, update, delete]
version: v6
```

Create the role with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create loginrule-manager.yaml
role 'loginrule-manager' has been created
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="loginrule-manager" !)

## Step 2/4. Create a Terraform configuration

Paste the following into a file called `main.tf` to configure the Terraform
provider and create two example Login Rules:

```
(!examples/resources/terraform/terraform-login-rules.tf!)
```

## Step 3/4. Apply the configuration

Init Terraform and apply the configuration:

```code
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
```

## Step 4/4. Make sure everything worked

Double-check that the new Login Rules are now available in your cluster:

```code
$ tctl get login_rules
kind: login_rule
metadata:
  description: Terraform test rule using traits_expression
  id: 1680190764978381000
  labels:
    example: "yes"
  name: terraform-test-expression-rule
spec:
  priority: 1
  traits_expression: |
    external.put("groups",
      choose(
        option(external.groups.contains("admins"),
external.groups.add("app-admins", "db-admins")),
        option(external.groups.contains("ops"),
external.groups.add("k8s-admins")),
        option(true, external.groups)))
version: v1
---
kind: login_rule
metadata:
  description: Terraform test rule using traits_map
  id: 1680193055097268000
  labels:
    example: "yes"
  name: terraform-test-map-rule
spec:
  priority: 0
  traits_map:
    groups:
    - external.groups
    logins:
    - strings.lower(external.username)
    - external.logins
version: v1
```

Test the Login Rules by sending some example input traits to the standard input
of the `tctl login_rule test` command and having it to load all Login Rules
from the cluster.

```code
$ echo '{"groups": ["admins", "ops"], "username": ["Alice"], "logins": ["user", "root"]}' | \
  tctl login_rule test --load-from-cluster
groups:
- admins
- ops
- app-admins
- db-admins
logins:
- alice
- user
- root
```

## Next Steps

- Read the [Terraform Guide](../../management/guides/terraform-provider.mdx) to
  learn more about configuring the Terraform provider.
- Read the [Login Rules reference](./reference.mdx) to learn mode about the
  Login Rule expression syntax.
